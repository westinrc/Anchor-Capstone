It was felt that a trial of an implanted \nintrathecal opioid pump might be of benefit to the patient.  She entered the \nhospital and began a trial of a morphine pump on **DATE[Aug 29 07]. \nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained alert and oriented, afebrile with \nstable vitals during her stay.   \nHowever, she experienced significant nausea and vomiting with very little \nrelief in her pre-existing pain during the morphine trial.  As a result, the \nintrathecal medication was changed from morphine to Dilaudid.  By postop day \nnumber 2, her nausea had cleared and she was tolerating p.o. intake.  \nHowever, despite large increases in the intrathecal administration rate, she \nreceived essentially no relief of her pretrial pain.   \nShe also complained of a severe positional headache on postop day number 1.  \nThis was treated with IV fluids and flat bed rest, and it resolved on its own \nprior to discharge.   \nThe patient's insertion site was clean, dry and intact.  Her motor exam and \nsensation to light touch appear to remain intact throughout her stay.  The \npatient noted that she had been prescribed fentanyl patches in the past.  \nHowever, she had syncopal episodes and apparent convulsions while using \nthese.  As a result, this medication could not be considered as an option \nwhen the patient was not receiving adequate relief from the Dilaudid trial.   \nFinally, on postop day number 3, secondary to failure of pain relief using \neither morphine or Dilaudid, and because of an inability to use fentanyl \nsecondary to prior historical problems with that medication, it was elected \nto end the trial.  The catheter was pulled without complications, and the \ncatheter insertion site was closed with a single pursestring stitch.   \nThe patient was medically safe for discharge home on postop day number 3.  \nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  \nACTIVITY:  \n1.   The patient may have activity as tolerated.\n2.   She may not drive motor vehicles if taking narcotics.\n3.   She may remove her dressing and begin showering on Friday, **DATE[Sep 02 07].  \nHowever, she should avoid tub baths, Jacuzzis, or soaking her incision for 2 \nweeks after surgery. \nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: \n1.   MS Contin 15 mg 1 p.o. t.i.d. \n2.   Vicodin 5/500 one to 2 p.o. q.4-6 hours p.r.n. maximum 8 per day #90 no \nrefills. \n3.   Senokot-S 1-2 p.o. nightly while on narcotics.\nFOLLOWUP:\n1.   She may have her suture removed by her local doctor in 7-10 days.\n2.   She should follow up with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] in 2-4 weeks.  Call **PHONE to \nschedule appointment.  \nThe patient was advised to notify her physician's office or 911 if she \nexperiences changes in orientation, balance, speech or coordination; swelling \nof the tongue, throat, difficulty with breathing or seizures.  Additionally, \nshe is to notify her surgeon's office if she experiences incisional redness, \nswelling or drainage; fever greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit with or \nwithout night sweats or chills; persistent headache or increased incisional \npain unrelieved by prescription medication and rest; new problems or changes \nin status, especially if not present before surgery, including worsening of \npain shooting down the arms or legs, new numbness or weakness or changes in \nbowel or bladder function.  She is given a copy of the preprinted discharge \ninstructions, which she indicated that she understood. \n\n___________________________________\n**NAME[YYY XXX ZZZ], M.D.\n\nDictator:  **NAME[UUU WWW, VVV-M]\n**INITIALS\nD:  **DATE[Sep 01 2007] 15:10:15\nT:  **DATE[Sep 01 2007] 17:56:03\nR:  **DATE[Sep 02 2007] 10:24:35/kt\nJob ID:  371372/**ID-NUM\n\n*** Dictated By: -**NAME[WWW, VVV-RRR] ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[YYY ZZZ]  **DATE[Sep 05 2007] 10:03:10 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In early \n**DATE[Oct], he was admitted with a pneumonia and new stroke.  It was feared at \nthat time that he may have had an endocarditis with an embolic stroke.  CT \nscan performed in early **DATE[Oct] showed a severe right upper lobe dense \nconsolidated pneumonia with air bronchograms which were not consistent with \npostobstructive pneumonia.  He was treated with Zosyn, after results of his \nsputum culture came back revealing Pseudomonas cepacia.  Apparently, he had \nhad a bronchoscopy done at **NAME[VVV] prior to that admission that grew some \nyeast, and there is concern about a possible yeast infection.  He was \ntransferred to rehabilitation on **DATE[Oct 9 2007], on Zosyn 4.5 IV q.12 hours \nfor 2 weeks total duration.  He developed diarrhea yesterday, and therefore \nwas readmitted with possible C. diff colitis.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for known coronary disease status post \nbypass grafting.  He is a very distant smoker.  No history of obstructive \nlung disease.  He had a history of rectal carcinoma status post a partial \ncolectomy with a colostomy.  \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Unhelpful.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pertinent for cough productive of frothy white sputum.  \nNo hemoptysis.  Denies fevers, chills, or sweats.  No chest pain, PND, \northopnea, or pedal edema.  He has been on oxygen since he was admitted to \nthe hospital in **DATE[Oct] with pneumonia.  \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/68, his \nheart rate is in the mid 90s, respiratory rate is 18.  His saturations in the \nmid 90s on 3 L nasal cannula.  He is an awake, alert, thin, ill-appearing \ngentleman in no distress.  Neck is supple without JVD.  His lungs are \nbronchial on the right, scattered rhonchi, no wheezes.  Regular rate and \nrhythm on cardiac exam, slightly tachycardic, no S3 or rub.  Abdomen is soft, \nscaphoid, no organomegaly or masses.  Ostomy in the left lower quadrant with \na bag filled with greenish liquid stool.  He had no significant edema.  \nLABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 136; potassium 3.4; chloride 106; bicarbonate 21; \nBUN and creatinine of 29 and 2.4; blood glucose of 97; white count of 17,300 \ndown from 19,800; H and H are 9.9/28.9 with 265,000 platelets.  Sputum is \ngrowing rare normal flora.  His CT scan shows persistence, although improved \naeration in the right upper lobe.  The left lower lobe and lateral lingula \nshow improvement in infiltrates.  \nMr. **NAME[AAA] is a gentleman that had a severe pneumonia.  Pneumococcus was \ncertainly a possible etiology that did not grow, although Pseudomonas cepacia \ndid eventually grow and he was treated with Zosyn.  Unfortunately, he seems \nto have developed C. diff, although those results are pending.  He is \ncurrently on Flagyl for that.  From a pulmonary standpoint, he still has \nsignificant radiographic abnormalities, but they have improved.  The air \nbronchograms are inconsistent with a postobstructive pneumonia.  At this \ntime, he has received adequate antibiotics and I would withhold further \nantibiotics from a pulmonary standpoint.  Mucomyst and nebulized \nbronchodilators are reasonable to help him clear his secretions, and he will \nneed a followup CT scan in about 2 months to document further clearing of \nthat upper lobe infiltrate.  \nThank you very much.  \n______________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], MD\nHS Job # 440707 / 36231 / \nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD: **DATE[Nov 02 2007] 11:36\nT: **DATE[Nov 02 2007] 11:41\n\n**CARBON-COPY\n\n\n\n\n',

The history, physical and plan were \nreviewed, I concur with their findings. I also independently examined and \nquestioned the patient.  \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  \nMr. **NAME[AAA] is **AGE[in 60s]-year-old gentleman who reportedly this morning forgot to \npick up his granddaughter from school, was then confused while driving and \nreportedly missed his driveway. The patient was seen at and outside hospital \nand a CT was done and there was what appeared to be an intracranial bleed \nversus mass seen. He was sent here for further evaluation by Neurosurgery. \nThe patient reports that he had a " mass in past" but it went away. He denies \nany focal numbness, weakness or tingling right now. No headache, no vision \nchanges, no nausea, no vomiting and no other medical symptoms to report. \nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \nHis review of systems is negative. \nHis allergies, past medical history and social history are per the resident \ndictation. \nHis medications are none. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nTemperature 36.9, 60, 118, 130/68.\nGENERAL: The patient is alert on my assessment. He is oriented to person and \nplace, but not so much the situation. He appears to be in no distress.  \nHEENT: The head is atraumatic. His pupils are equal and around. Sclerae is \nanicteric, unable to evaluate the fundus. Oropharynx is clear and moist.  \nNECK: The neck is supple. \nCARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm.\nLUNGS: The lungs are clear to auscultation.\nABDOMEN: The abdomen is soft, nontender and nondistended.\nNEURO: Neurologically his speech is clear and fluent, occasionally he is not \nmaking sense. I would give him a GCS of 14. On motor exam he has no evidence \nof pronator drift and (5/5) strength in the upper and lower extremities. \nFinger-to-nose is intact bilaterally.  \nED COURSE AND MEDICAL DECISION:  \nThe patient was seen by myself and the resident. The gentleman had either a \nbleed or a mass on his head CT at the posterior portion in the ventricle. It \nwas well demarcated and it appears to be more or a mass with possible \ncalcification or bleeding. We will repeat the head CT and obtain a MRI per \nNeurosurgery recommendation. The patient was planned to be a direct admit to \n5F and we are awaiting for his bed at this time. He otherwise remained \nneurologically intact during my exam, except as above and this was unchanged. \n\nRoutine laboratory data was sent. His INR is pending, but from the outside \nhospital this was less than 1. He is on no anticoagulants. I do not think \nthis represents meningitis or encephalolitis at this time. We will have him \nadmitted to neurosurgery.  \nADMISSION DIAGNOSIS(ES): \nINTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE.\nAdmit to Neurosurgery **ROOM. _____________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], M.D.\nEMERGENCY MEDICINE \nAttending Physician \nDictator:  **NAME[WWW XXX], M.D.\nJK/dab\nD:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 17:45:26\nT:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 18:10:22\nR:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 18:10:22/dab\nJob ID:  367006/**ID-NUM\nCc:\n\n*** Dictated By: -**NAME[XXX, RRR] ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[WWW XXX]  **DATE[Mar 02 2007] 11:02:31 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

Subtle decreased signal within the sulci near the left\nvertex as well as within the bilateral parafalcine anterior\nfrontal lobes is consistent with prior blood products as well.

XXX], M.D.\nDATE OF ADMISSION:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007]\nDATE OF CONSULTATION:  **DATE[Feb 30 07]\nAt the request of Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ, M] consulted on Mr. **NAME[AAA], a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old \nman, who presented to the hospital with a one-day history of confusion.  Two \ndays ago he was very active.  Imaging studies showed evidence of a \nhemorrhagic mass within the splenium of the corpus callosum.  Today when I \nsaw the patient, he had significantly improved and was asking appropriate \nquestions. \nInterestingly, the patient had presented with some back pain and headache \nback in **DATE[May] where imaging studies showed evidence of lumbar disk disease.  \nHowever, an MRI scan was also done showing evidence of FLAIR signal change \nwithin the corpus callosum.  This was observed.  An **DATE[Sep 2006] scan was reported \nto show significant resolution of the mass. I reviewed both of these studies \nand was concerned that perhaps the **DATE[Sep] scan did not show it because of the \ndifferent slice thicknesses.  However, the lesion did appear smaller in \n**DATE[Sep].  He had an MRI scan in this hospital during this admission which \ncontinued to show FLAIR change in the corpus callosum with gradient imaging \nthat showed the hemorrhage.  A CT scan also showed hemorrhage.  There was \nminimal enhancement.  An angiogram was performed today which was reportedly \nnegative for a vascular malformation or other specific disease.   \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nOn examination the patient was awake, alert, and has answered questions \nappropriately.  Language is normal.  He showed insight into his problems.  \nEye movements were full with slight restriction of up gaze.  There was no \nlimb drift.  Power was full.   \nI reviewed all the imaging studies with his family.  We talked about \nmanagement options including observation with serial imaging studies, empiric \ntherapy which we did not recommend, and believe that few would empirically \nirradiate this lesion, a stereotactic biopsy to obtain a histologic diagnosis \nto guide further management, or craniotomy (we told them that the lesion was \ntoo small and deep for a craniotomy).  There was a family history of \nmeningioma, but we thought this lesion did not look like that.   \nPLAN:\nOur plan is to allow him to recover from the small hemorrhage and obtain a \nrepeat MRI scan in two days' time.  If he is well, we will discharge him and \nbring him back next week for an MRI-guided stereotactic brain biopsy.  The \nrisks of this were explained including bleeding in the brain causing stroke, \ndeath, the need for craniotomy, lack of diagnosis, memory problems, seizures, \nheadache, or lack of a good result.  All questions were answered and we will \nmake arrangements for surgery next week.   \n\n___________________________________\n**NAME[WWW M. XXX], M.D.\n\nDictator:  **NAME[WWW M.

The patient's chief complaint is increasing \ncolostomy output and weakness.\nThe patient's history began late **DATE[Sep 2007] when he felling incurring a \nclavicle fracture.  He was treated at **INSTITUTION.  While there, he \ndeveloped sepsis and transferred to **INSTITUTION for further \ntreatment and management.  Blood cultures from **INSTITUTION grew E. coli.  \nWhile at **INSTITUTION, the patient was found to have a right lung pneumonia on \nchest x-ray as well as CT scan.  He completed a course Zosyn.  During his \nstay, the patient developed a sudden onset right hemiparesis from a left \nparietal and bilateral inferior cerebellar CVA.  The patient was placed on \naspirin and Plavix.  He was discharged to **INSTITUTION, **PLACE for a \nrehabilitation program. \nThe patient stayed approximately a week and a half.  He was readmitted to \n**INSTITUTION with a productive cough.  Workup included bronchoscopy which \nrevealed a fungal infection on cultures.  The patient was placed on IV \nDiflucan and subsequently discharged back to **INSTITUTION, **PLACE.\nRecently, the patient was admitted to **INSTITUTION with increasing \ncolostomy output.  He was noted to have leukocytosis with a white count of \n24,000 and 23% bandemia.  The patient was transferred to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Nov 1 2007], for further treatment.\nThe patient was diagnosed as having C. difficile colitis.  His C. difficile \ntoxin assay was positive from his **DATE[Nov 1 2007], stool sample.  His blood \ncultures have shown no growth.  The patient has been placed on Lactobacillus \nalong with Flagyl.  He has shown clinical improvement with decreased \ncolostomy output.  His WBC count has decreased to 8.6.  The patient was also \ndehydrated, and his creatinine since improved to 1.4.  His chest CT showed \npersistent right upper lobe consolidation, but overall improved from previous \nradiographs.\nFrom a functional standpoint, the patient requires minimal assistance with \nhis transfer, minimal assistance to ambulate 5 feet using a wheeled walker, \nand requiring assistance to open his containers during meals.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery \nbypass graft in 2001, history of MI, hypertension, colorectal CA status post \ncolostomy 15 years ago, and hyperlipidemia.\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.\nALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\nMEDICATIONS:  As listed in the 36-hour report.  I have reviewed this list.\nPERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired coal miner.  He lived \nalone prior to his admission.  A former smoker.  Drinks alcohol occasionally. \nHe was independent prior to admission.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient feels tired and weak.  His right is weaker \ncompared to his left.  He denies any chest pain.  He does have exertional \ndyspnea, but overall better.  He reports cough, but this is also improved.  \nHe denies any swallowing problems.  Currently has a Foley catheter in place.  \nHe reports being continent prior to admission.  He has no neck or back pain.  \nHe denies any numbness or paresthesias.  Rest of his review of systems is \nnegative.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is thin elderly male.  He is awake.  He is \nalert.  He is oriented x3 in no acute distress.  His voice is wet and gurgly, \nhypophonic, but easily understandable.  Heart:  Distant.  Lungs:  With \nscattered rhonchi.  Abdomen: Soft and nontender.  Extremities: He has trace \nbilateral pretibial edema.  Skin:  Dry and scaly.  I did not look at his \nsacral coccyx for any pressure ulcers.  Neurologic:  He has full passive \nrange of motion of both upper and lower extremities with minimal pain at the \nend range.  Manual testing, left upper extremity is 5/5, right upper \nextremity is 3 to 4 over 5; in both lower extremities, it is limited \nsecondary to his position, but left TA and EHL is 5/5 and right TA and EHL is \n4+/5.  Muscle stretch reflexes are slightly brisker on the right.  He does \nnot have any clonus, and his plantar reflex is equivocal.  He does have \ndysmetria in both upper extremities, more significant on the right.\nIMPRESSION:  The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old male with a history of left \nparietal cerebrovascular accident and right hemiparesis.  He is admitted with \nClostridium difficile colitis.  He has had extensive and complicated course \nsince his initial admission in **DATE[Sep 2007].  He is not at his functional \nbaseline with decline in functional mobility, self care, as well as speech.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  \n1.  Consider modified barium swallow to evaluate his current swallowing \nstatus.\n2.  Agree with deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.\n3.  The patient will require an admission to the acute inpatient \nrehabilitation service.  He has the comprehensive therapy needs with physical \ntherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language pathology to address \nhis functional decline as well as extensive active medical issues requiring \nclose supervision and judicious management.\nThank you for allowing me to participate in his care.\n______________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], MD\nHS Job # 503658 / 36756 / \nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD: **DATE[Nov 04 2007] 18:20\nT: **DATE[Nov 05 2007] 03:41\n\n**CARBON-COPY\n\n\n\n\n",

He was doing well at the rehab; \nhowever, on the night before the day of admission, he started to have \ndiarrhea.  He did not respond to treatment.  C. diff toxin was sent, but the \npatient became hypotensive, his creatinine went up to 2 and BUN became \nelevated.  He became tachycardic, and showing irregular heart beats.  For all \nthese reasons, he was transferred to **INSTITUTION for further \nmanagement and evaluation.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with initial problems that \nincluded severe diarrhea confirmed later to be from C. diff colitis, it was \ntreated with Flagyl and Lactinex\n\\\tand seemed to improve slowly.\nHis other issue was hypotension and tachycardia related to dehydration and \nlow volume.  It was corrected with IV fluids.\nHe had renal failure on admission, the creatinine was 2.0 and elevated BUN.  \nThat seemed to correct with IV fluids, creatinine improved down to 1.2.\nHe was tachycardic and showing irregular heart beats on admission, that \nseemed to improve to normal sinus rhythm with controlled rate at the time of \ndischarge.\nThe patient had swelling in the right arm, there was question of DVT.  \nHowever,  venous Dopplers came back negative.  I would still watch that \nclosely, consider further evaluation if the swelling continues.\nThe patient continues to have the problem with dysphagia.  He is on dysphagia \ndiet.\nHowever, his main complaint and problem seem to be persistent congestion in \nthe lungs and sputum production and cough.  He had recent pneumonia which \nseemed to be getting better on CT scan and chest x-ray.  I wonder if he has \neither components of microaspiration or postnasal drip which could be \ncontributing.  Appropriate treatments are being given to that.  Other agents \ncould be added later in the future.\nAs the patient seemed to improve from the diarrhea standpoint and as his \nkidney function coming back to normal, his blood pressure and heart rate are \nimproving, we felt that he could go back to the **INSTITUTION Rehab to continue \nphysical therapy and rehabilitation.  He will continue his medications.  He \nneeds to follow up with his right arm swelling and his lung status.\nLABORATORY DATA:  Prior to discharge, his stool for occult blood was \nnegative.  His sodium was 140, potassium 3.9, chloride 119, BUN 17, \ncreatinine 1.4, calcium 8.2.  His INR was 21, TIBC 1 was 7 and iron \nsaturation was 20%, ferritin 251.\nHemoglobin was 9.0, hematocrit 26.8, and platelet count 255.\nDISPOSITION:  **INSTITUTION Rehab in stable condition.

The \npatient himself mentioned about him not feeling very well, so the family took \nthe patient to the emergency department where he was found to be disoriented \nto time, place, and person and subsequent CT scan of the head showed a lesion \nin his brain that looked either a tumor or bleeding.  For further evaluation, \nthe patient was referred to Neurosurgery, Dr. **NAME[ZZZ], for further evaluation, \nand presented to the emergency department.  On presentation to the emergency \ndepartment, the patient was awake, alert, but not oriented.  He was confused \nwith time, date, and also place.  He denied any headache, nausea, vomiting, \ndifficulty moving his extremities, or sensory problems.   \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \nThe past medical history includes:\n1. Surgical appendectomy.\n2. Lipoma resection.\n3. Also tonsillectomy.\nMEDICATIONS:\nThe patient states that he does not take any medications.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  \nHe does not smoke, drinks about a bottle of beer a day.\nALLERGIES:\nNO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nGENERAL:  This is a Caucasian male not in acute distress; however, confused \nand disoriented to time, place, and person.   \nVITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 130/68, pulse is 66 and regular, respiratory \nrate is 17, and saturation is 100% on two liters nasal cannula.   \nHEENT:  Pupils are equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular \nmovements are intact, no diplopia.   \nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.\nEXTREMITIES:  No swelling or redness.\nNEURO:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Strength is 5/5 throughout.  \nSensation is intact.   \nLABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:\nA CT scan of the head obtained showed a brain lesion, possible tumor or \nbleed.  An MRI was ordered and the result is pending by the time of \ndictation.  Blood work was obtained.  Those were not significantly abnormal.  \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThis is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old male who has questionable history of a brain tumor in \nthe past without any treatment who presented with confusion, found to have a \nbrain lesion by CT scan.  The patient continues to be confused; however, \nvital signs were stable and there was no significant neurological finding \nother than his confusion.  Here Neurosurgery was  \ncontacted and since the patient already had a bed under Dr. **NAME[ZZZ], he was \nadmitted to 5F for further evaluation of his brain lesion.  The patient \nremained hemodynamically and neurologically stable throughout this emergency \ndepartment stay. \nADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  BRAIN MASS.\n___________________________________\n**NAME[RRR QQQ], M.D.\n\nDictator:  **NAME[WWW XXX], M.D.\n**INITIALS\nD:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 18:38:13\nT:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 19:47:41\nR:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 19:47:41/klf\nJob ID:  367063/**ID-NUM\nCc:\n\n*** Dictated By: -**NAME[XXX, PPP] ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[RRR QQQ]  **DATE[Mar 02 2007] 11:02:34 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

In early \n**DATE[Oct], he was admitted with a pneumonia and new stroke.  It was feared at \nthat time that he may have had an endocarditis with an embolic stroke.  CT \nscan performed in early **DATE[Oct] showed a severe right upper lobe dense \nconsolidated pneumonia with air bronchograms which were not consistent with \npostobstructive pneumonia.  He was treated with Zosyn, after results of his \nsputum culture came back revealing Pseudomonas cepacia.  Apparently, he had \nhad a bronchoscopy done at **NAME[VVV] prior to that admission that grew some \nyeast, and there is concern about a possible yeast infection.  He was \ntransferred to rehabilitation on **DATE[Oct 9 2007], on Zosyn 4.5 IV q.12 hours \nfor 2 weeks total duration.  He developed diarrhea yesterday, and therefore \nwas readmitted with possible C. diff colitis.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for known coronary disease status post \nbypass grafting.  He is a very distant smoker.  No history of obstructive \nlung disease.  He had a history of rectal carcinoma status post a partial \ncolectomy with a colostomy.  \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Unhelpful.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pertinent for cough productive of frothy white sputum.  \nNo hemoptysis.  Denies fevers, chills, or sweats.  No chest pain, PND, \northopnea, or pedal edema.  He has been on oxygen since he was admitted to \nthe hospital in **DATE[Oct] with pneumonia.  \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/68, his \nheart rate is in the mid 90s, respiratory rate is 18.  His saturations in the \nmid 90s on 3 L nasal cannula.  He is an awake, alert, thin, ill-appearing \ngentleman in no distress.  Neck is supple without JVD.  His lungs are \nbronchial on the right, scattered rhonchi, no wheezes.  Regular rate and \nrhythm on cardiac exam, slightly tachycardic, no S3 or rub.  Abdomen is soft, \nscaphoid, no organomegaly or masses.  Ostomy in the left lower quadrant with \na bag filled with greenish liquid stool.  He had no significant edema.  \nLABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 136; potassium 3.4; chloride 106; bicarbonate 21; \nBUN and creatinine of 29 and 2.4; blood glucose of 97; white count of 17,300 \ndown from 19,800; H and H are 9.9/28.9 with 265,000 platelets.  Sputum is \ngrowing rare normal flora.  His CT scan shows persistence, although improved \naeration in the right upper lobe.  The left lower lobe and lateral lingula \nshow improvement in infiltrates.  \nMr. **NAME[AAA] is a gentleman that had a severe pneumonia.  Pneumococcus was \ncertainly a possible etiology that did not grow, although Pseudomonas cepacia \ndid eventually grow and he was treated with Zosyn.  Unfortunately, he seems \nto have developed C. diff, although those results are pending.  He is \ncurrently on Flagyl for that.  From a pulmonary standpoint, he still has \nsignificant radiographic abnormalities, but they have improved.  The air \nbronchograms are inconsistent with a postobstructive pneumonia.  At this \ntime, he has received adequate antibiotics and I would withhold further \nantibiotics from a pulmonary standpoint.  Mucomyst and nebulized \nbronchodilators are reasonable to help him clear his secretions, and he will \nneed a followup CT scan in about 2 months to document further clearing of \nthat upper lobe infiltrate.  \nThank you very much.  \n______________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], MD\nHS Job # 440707 / 36231 / \nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD: **DATE[Nov 02 2007] 11:36\nT: **DATE[Nov 02 2007] 11:41\n\n**CARBON-COPY\n\n\n\n\n',

Also, during this time period the patient had shortness of breath \nand a cough productive of frothy white sputum.  His sputum cultures grew \n(_______________).  This was thought to be a contamination and a CT scan of \nthe chest showed multilobar pneumonia.  The patient was treated with IV \nZosyn.  He was kept on 1 liter of oxygen by nasal cannula, flutter valve \ntreatment, physical therapy, DuoNebs, and expectorant treatment was given.  \nAlso, during the hospital stay the patient was markedly depressed and was \nkept on Zoloft.  The patient was transferred on **DATE[Oct 9 2007], to \n**INSTITUTION Rehabilitation at **PLACE where his antibiotics for 2 weeks \nfor a completion of a 2-weeks'  course were continued.  About a week ago the \npatient was transferred to **NAME[VVV] again with productive cough of frothy \nsputum and shortness of breath.  Over there, Dr. (_______________) did a \nbronchoscopy.  According to his note, there was no endobronchial lesion in \nthe right upper lobe.  In the post bronchoscopy sputum and washings the \npatient grew fungus.  By this time on evaluating his imaging, he mentions in \nhis note that originally there was a right lower lobe, right upper lobe, and \nleft lower lobe infiltrate which are resolving.  The right upper lobe \ninfiltrate, however, is still persistent.  The patient was discharged back to \nSouthside Rehabilitation on IV Diflucan, starting on **DATE[Oct 27 2007].  At \nSouthside Rehabilitation the patient continued to have his productive cough \nand yesterday IV Zosyn was added by the patient's PCP.  He also added Flagyl \n500 mg p.o. t.i.d. to cover for C. difficile colitis.  Yesterday, the patient \nhad a sudden increase in colostomy output.  During 1 shift he had 1700 cc put \nout.  Also, he was noted to have a fever.  His white cell count yesterday had \njumped up to 24,000.  On **DATE[Oct 28 2007], it was 7.9.  Neutrophil count was \n72% and bandemia was 23%.  A sepsis workup was done and the patient was \npositive for C. difficile colitis.  Also, his UA was consistent with a UTI.  \nToday, the patient was noted to have a blood pressure of 80 to 90 systolic, \nwas tachycardic, and was noted to have PACs.  For this reason the patient was \ntransferred to **INSTITUTION for further management.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient had an MI in 1991.  In 2001 he had a \n4-vessel CABG.  He has hypertension.  Fifteen years ago he was diagnosed with \nrectal cancer.  He underwent a surgery and sustained a colostomy from that \nsurgery.  Since then he has not had any chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  \nHe is not being followed up by any oncologist and neither does he have a \ncardiologist.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per his history of present illness.  Also, the patient \nhas anorexia, decreased p.o. intake, and nausea.  He has been vomiting.  He \nhas intermittent fevers and chills.  His fevers are up to 101.  He complains \nof shortness of breath on exertion; however, these days he is not exerting \nhimself too much.  As mentioned above, he has a cough productive of foamy \nwhite sputum.  He has had significant weight loss; however, he does not know \nhow much.  He does complain of intermittent urinary incontinence.\nMEDICATIONS:  \n1.  Aggrenox 25/200 mg tablet 1 tablet b.i.d.\n2.  Lomotil 1 tablet q.6 h.\n3.  Diflucan 100 mg IV q.12 .\n4.  Humibid 2 tablets p.o. b.i.d.\n5.  Subcu heparin.\n6.  Ferrex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n7.  Megace 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n8.

Benazepril 20 mg p.o. daily.\nALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient used to live alone up until **DATE[Sep].  Prior to \nthat, especially in the summers, he did extensive gardening work.  He is a \nretired coal miner.  He has a remote history of tobacco use.  He stopped \nabout 50 years ago and has an approximate 10-year-pack history.  He has \noccasional ethanol intake.  He denies IV drug use.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is an elderly gentleman.  He looks very wasted \nand cachectic.  He is alert and cooperative.  Blood pressure 112/52, pulse \n100, respiratory rate 18, temperature 36.7, saturations 95.  HEENT:  The \npatient is very cachectic and he has temporal wasting.  Otherwise, \nextraocular muscles are intact.  Pupils are bilaterally equally reactive to \nlight.  He has moist mucous membranes.  No cervical lymphadenopathy.  There \nis no JVP.  Cardiovascular  Exam:  There is a central sternotomy scar.  He \nhas a normal S1, S2 with a systolic murmur.  He is slightly tachycardic.  \nPulmonary Exam:  The patient has coarse crackles, right more than the left \nside.  The crackles are in the lower and mid zone.  There is mid and upper \nzone bronchial breathing on the right-hand side.  On the left side there are \ncoarse crackles, particularly at the bases.  There is intermittent wheezing.  \nAbdomen is soft, looks slightly distended, and he is tender diffusely.  The \nleft half of his abdomen - he has a colostomy in place with greenish feces.  \nGut sounds are audible but reduced.  Lower Extremities:  There is no edema.  \nThe patient has right upper and lower extremity weakness.\nLABS:  All labs are pending at this point in time.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old gentleman with a complicated \npast medical history since the past 2 months or so.  He presents from \nSouthside Rehabilitation with the following issues.\n1.  Clostridium difficile colitis.  The patient has been started on Flagyl \n500 mg p.o. t.i.d.  His Zosyn has been put on hold.  We are also starting \nLactinex 1 pack p.o. q.i.d.  I will check an abdominal x-ray as the patient \nis complaining of abdominal tenderness.  This is to rule out any toxic \nmegacolon or perforation.\n2.  Multilobar pneumonia.  The patient has already received Zosyn last month \nfor 2 weeks for this.  He has recently been started on Diflucan based on \nfungus that was grown in his bronchial washings.  I do not have the details \navailable of the bronchial report or the culture at this point in time.  We \nwill continue the IV Diflucan.  We will check a CT scan of the chest without \ncontrast.  We will consult Dr. **NAME[UUU]'s group.  We will also continue the \npatient's DuoNeb, Mucomyst, and guaifenesin and send off sputum cultures.\n3.  Dehydration and prerenal azotemia.  Reportedly, the patient has had a \nbump in his creatinine.  A couple of days ago, his creatinine was 0.9 and now \nit has increased to 3 at the rehabilitation.  This most likely seems prerenal \nbecause of the dehydration and decreased p.o. intake as well as vomiting.  We \nwill generously hydrate the patient.  The patient has been started on normal \nsaline at 200 mL per hour.  We will generously hydrate as the patient's \nejection fraction is 60%.  He does have a history of diastolic dysfunction.  \nTherefore, we will be careful not to cause volume overload.  Check urine \nelectrolytes but we will hold off on any further renal workup.  We will hold \nany nephrotoxic medications and renally adjust his medications.\n4.  Ectopic beats.  I will check an EKG and place the patient on a monitor.\n5.  Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, gastrointestinal prophylaxis, PT, and \nOT consult.  We will consult social work.\nThe patient has been discussed with the attending.\n______________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], Resident\nHS Job # 432079 / 36382 / \nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD: **DATE[Nov 01 2007] 20:17\nT: **DATE[Nov 01 2007] 20:40\n\n**CARBON-COPY\n\n\n\n\n",

The patient's chief complaint is increasing \ncolostomy output and weakness.\nThe patient's history began late **DATE[Sep 2007] when he felling incurring a \nclavicle fracture.  He was treated at **INSTITUTION.  While there, he \ndeveloped sepsis and transferred to **INSTITUTION for further \ntreatment and management.  Blood cultures from **INSTITUTION grew E. coli.  \nWhile at **INSTITUTION, the patient was found to have a right lung pneumonia on \nchest x-ray as well as CT scan.  He completed a course Zosyn.  During his \nstay, the patient developed a sudden onset right hemiparesis from a left \nparietal and bilateral inferior cerebellar CVA.  The patient was placed on \naspirin and Plavix.  He was discharged to **INSTITUTION, **PLACE for a \nrehabilitation program. \nThe patient stayed approximately a week and a half.  He was readmitted to \n**INSTITUTION with a productive cough.  Workup included bronchoscopy which \nrevealed a fungal infection on cultures.  The patient was placed on IV \nDiflucan and subsequently discharged back to **INSTITUTION, **PLACE.\nRecently, the patient was admitted to **INSTITUTION with increasing \ncolostomy output.  He was noted to have leukocytosis with a white count of \n24,000 and 23% bandemia.  The patient was transferred to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Nov 1 2007], for further treatment.\nThe patient was diagnosed as having C. difficile colitis.  His C. difficile \ntoxin assay was positive from his **DATE[Nov 1 2007], stool sample.  His blood \ncultures have shown no growth.  The patient has been placed on Lactobacillus \nalong with Flagyl.  He has shown clinical improvement with decreased \ncolostomy output.  His WBC count has decreased to 8.6.  The patient was also \ndehydrated, and his creatinine since improved to 1.4.  His chest CT showed \npersistent right upper lobe consolidation, but overall improved from previous \nradiographs.\nFrom a functional standpoint, the patient requires minimal assistance with \nhis transfer, minimal assistance to ambulate 5 feet using a wheeled walker, \nand requiring assistance to open his containers during meals.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery \nbypass graft in 2001, history of MI, hypertension, colorectal CA status post \ncolostomy 15 years ago, and hyperlipidemia.\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.\nALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\nMEDICATIONS:  As listed in the 36-hour report.  I have reviewed this list.\nPERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired coal miner.  He lived \nalone prior to his admission.  A former smoker.  Drinks alcohol occasionally. \nHe was independent prior to admission.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient feels tired and weak.  His right is weaker \ncompared to his left.  He denies any chest pain.  He does have exertional \ndyspnea, but overall better.  He reports cough, but this is also improved.  \nHe denies any swallowing problems.  Currently has a Foley catheter in place.  \nHe reports being continent prior to admission.  He has no neck or back pain.  \nHe denies any numbness or paresthesias.  Rest of his review of systems is \nnegative.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is thin elderly male.  He is awake.  He is \nalert.  He is oriented x3 in no acute distress.  His voice is wet and gurgly, \nhypophonic, but easily understandable.  Heart:  Distant.  Lungs:  With \nscattered rhonchi.  Abdomen: Soft and nontender.  Extremities: He has trace \nbilateral pretibial edema.  Skin:  Dry and scaly.  I did not look at his \nsacral coccyx for any pressure ulcers.  Neurologic:  He has full passive \nrange of motion of both upper and lower extremities with minimal pain at the \nend range.  Manual testing, left upper extremity is 5/5, right upper \nextremity is 3 to 4 over 5; in both lower extremities, it is limited \nsecondary to his position, but left TA and EHL is 5/5 and right TA and EHL is \n4+/5.  Muscle stretch reflexes are slightly brisker on the right.  He does \nnot have any clonus, and his plantar reflex is equivocal.  He does have \ndysmetria in both upper extremities, more significant on the right.\nIMPRESSION:  The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old male with a history of left \nparietal cerebrovascular accident and right hemiparesis.  He is admitted with \nClostridium difficile colitis.  He has had extensive and complicated course \nsince his initial admission in **DATE[Sep 2007].  He is not at his functional \nbaseline with decline in functional mobility, self care, as well as speech.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  \n1.  Consider modified barium swallow to evaluate his current swallowing \nstatus.\n2.  Agree with deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.\n3.  The patient will require an admission to the acute inpatient \nrehabilitation service.  He has the comprehensive therapy needs with physical \ntherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language pathology to address \nhis functional decline as well as extensive active medical issues requiring \nclose supervision and judicious management.\nThank you for allowing me to participate in his care.\n______________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], MD\nHS Job # 503658 / 36756 / \nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD: **DATE[Nov 04 2007] 18:20\nT: **DATE[Nov 05 2007] 03:41\n\n**CARBON-COPY\n\n\n\n\n",

He was doing well at the rehab; \nhowever, on the night before the day of admission, he started to have \ndiarrhea.  He did not respond to treatment.  C. diff toxin was sent, but the \npatient became hypotensive, his creatinine went up to 2 and BUN became \nelevated.  He became tachycardic, and showing irregular heart beats.  For all \nthese reasons, he was transferred to **INSTITUTION for further \nmanagement and evaluation.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with initial problems that \nincluded severe diarrhea confirmed later to be from C. diff colitis, it was \ntreated with Flagyl and Lactinex\n\\\tand seemed to improve slowly.\nHis other issue was hypotension and tachycardia related to dehydration and \nlow volume.  It was corrected with IV fluids.\nHe had renal failure on admission, the creatinine was 2.0 and elevated BUN.  \nThat seemed to correct with IV fluids, creatinine improved down to 1.2.\nHe was tachycardic and showing irregular heart beats on admission, that \nseemed to improve to normal sinus rhythm with controlled rate at the time of \ndischarge.\nThe patient had swelling in the right arm, there was question of DVT.  \nHowever,  venous Dopplers came back negative.  I would still watch that \nclosely, consider further evaluation if the swelling continues.\nThe patient continues to have the problem with dysphagia.  He is on dysphagia \ndiet.\nHowever, his main complaint and problem seem to be persistent congestion in \nthe lungs and sputum production and cough.  He had recent pneumonia which \nseemed to be getting better on CT scan and chest x-ray.  I wonder if he has \neither components of microaspiration or postnasal drip which could be \ncontributing.  Appropriate treatments are being given to that.  Other agents \ncould be added later in the future.\nAs the patient seemed to improve from the diarrhea standpoint and as his \nkidney function coming back to normal, his blood pressure and heart rate are \nimproving, we felt that he could go back to the **INSTITUTION Rehab to continue \nphysical therapy and rehabilitation.  He will continue his medications.  He \nneeds to follow up with his right arm swelling and his lung status.\nLABORATORY DATA:  Prior to discharge, his stool for occult blood was \nnegative.  His sodium was 140, potassium 3.9, chloride 119, BUN 17, \ncreatinine 1.4, calcium 8.2.  His INR was 21, TIBC 1 was 7 and iron \nsaturation was 20%, ferritin 251.\nHemoglobin was 9.0, hematocrit 26.8, and platelet count 255.\nDISPOSITION:  **INSTITUTION Rehab in stable condition.  Continue to follow at \nthat institution.    \n______________________________\n**NAME[YYY ZZZ], MD\nHS Job # 573690 / 33110 / \nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD: **DATE[Dec 18 2007] 18:57\nT: **DATE[Dec 18 2007] 21:03\n\n*** Transcribed On: **ID-NUM ***\n*** Dictated By: 008687^**NAME[ZZZ^YYY] ***\n*** Clinical Date : **ID-NUM ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[YYY ZZZ]  **DATE[Dec 21 2007] 01:21:17 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

It was felt that a trial of an implanted \nintrathecal opioid pump might be of benefit to the patient.  She entered the \nhospital and began a trial of a morphine pump on **DATE[Aug 29 07]. \nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained alert and oriented, afebrile with \nstable vitals during her stay.   \nHowever, she experienced significant nausea and vomiting with very little \nrelief in her pre-existing pain during the morphine trial.  As a result, the \nintrathecal medication was changed from morphine to Dilaudid.  By postop day \nnumber 2, her nausea had cleared and she was tolerating p.o. intake.  \nHowever, despite large increases in the intrathecal administration rate, she \nreceived essentially no relief of her pretrial pain.   \nShe also complained of a severe positional headache on postop day number 1.  \nThis was treated with IV fluids and flat bed rest, and it resolved on its own \nprior to discharge.   \nThe patient's insertion site was clean, dry and intact.  Her motor exam and \nsensation to light touch appear to remain intact throughout her stay.  The \npatient noted that she had been prescribed fentanyl patches in the past.  \nHowever, she had syncopal episodes and apparent convulsions while using \nthese.  As a result, this medication could not be considered as an option \nwhen the patient was not receiving adequate relief from the Dilaudid trial.   \nFinally, on postop day number 3, secondary to failure of pain relief using \neither morphine or Dilaudid, and because of an inability to use fentanyl \nsecondary to prior historical problems with that medication, it was elected \nto end the trial.  The catheter was pulled without complications, and the \ncatheter insertion site was closed with a single pursestring stitch.   \nThe patient was medically safe for discharge home on postop day number 3.  \nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  \nACTIVITY:  \n1.   The patient may have activity as tolerated.\n2.   She may not drive motor vehicles if taking narcotics.\n3.   She may remove her dressing and begin showering on Friday, **DATE[Sep 02 07].  \nHowever, she should avoid tub baths, Jacuzzis, or soaking her incision for 2 \nweeks after surgery. \nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: \n1.   MS Contin 15 mg 1 p.o. t.i.d. \n2.   Vicodin 5/500 one to 2 p.o. q.4-6 hours p.r.n. maximum 8 per day #90 no \nrefills. \n3.   Senokot-S 1-2 p.o. nightly while on narcotics.\nFOLLOWUP:\n1.   She may have her suture removed by her local doctor in 7-10 days.\n2.   She should follow up with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] in 2-4 weeks.  Call **PHONE to \nschedule appointment.  \nThe patient was advised to notify her physician's office or 911 if she \nexperiences changes in orientation, balance, speech or coordination; swelling \nof the tongue, throat, difficulty with breathing or seizures.  Additionally, \nshe is to notify her surgeon's office if she experiences incisional redness, \nswelling or drainage; fever greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit with or \nwithout night sweats or chills; persistent headache or increased incisional \npain unrelieved by prescription medication and rest; new problems or changes \nin status, especially if not present before surgery, including worsening of \npain shooting down the arms or legs, new numbness or weakness or changes in \nbowel or bladder function.  She is given a copy of the preprinted discharge \ninstructions, which she indicated that she understood. \n\n___________________________________\n**NAME[YYY XXX ZZZ], M.D.\n\nDictator:  **NAME[UUU WWW, VVV-M]\n**INITIALS\nD:  **DATE[Sep 01 2007] 15:10:15\nT:  **DATE[Sep 01 2007] 17:56:03\nR:  **DATE[Sep 02 2007] 10:24:35/kt\nJob ID:  371372/**ID-NUM\n\n*** Dictated By: -**NAME[WWW, VVV-RRR] ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[YYY ZZZ]  **DATE[Sep 05 2007] 10:03:10 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In early \n**DATE[Oct], he was admitted with a pneumonia and new stroke.  It was feared at \nthat time that he may have had an endocarditis with an embolic stroke.  CT \nscan performed in early **DATE[Oct] showed a severe right upper lobe dense \nconsolidated pneumonia with air bronchograms which were not consistent with \npostobstructive pneumonia.  He was treated with Zosyn, after results of his \nsputum culture came back revealing Pseudomonas cepacia.  Apparently, he had \nhad a bronchoscopy done at **NAME[VVV] prior to that admission that grew some \nyeast, and there is concern about a possible yeast infection.  He was \ntransferred to rehabilitation on **DATE[Oct 9 2007], on Zosyn 4.5 IV q.12 hours \nfor 2 weeks total duration.  He developed diarrhea yesterday, and therefore \nwas readmitted with possible C. diff colitis.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for known coronary disease status post \nbypass grafting.  He is a very distant smoker.  No history of obstructive \nlung disease.  He had a history of rectal carcinoma status post a partial \ncolectomy with a colostomy.  \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Unhelpful.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pertinent for cough productive of frothy white sputum.  \nNo hemoptysis.  Denies fevers, chills, or sweats.  No chest pain, PND, \northopnea, or pedal edema.  He has been on oxygen since he was admitted to \nthe hospital in **DATE[Oct] with pneumonia.  \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/68, his \nheart rate is in the mid 90s, respiratory rate is 18.  His saturations in the \nmid 90s on 3 L nasal cannula.  He is an awake, alert, thin, ill-appearing \ngentleman in no distress.  Neck is supple without JVD.  His lungs are \nbronchial on the right, scattered rhonchi, no wheezes.  Regular rate and \nrhythm on cardiac exam, slightly tachycardic, no S3 or rub.  Abdomen is soft, \nscaphoid, no organomegaly or masses.  Ostomy in the left lower quadrant with \na bag filled with greenish liquid stool.  He had no significant edema.  \nLABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 136; potassium 3.4; chloride 106; bicarbonate 21; \nBUN and creatinine of 29 and 2.4; blood glucose of 97; white count of 17,300 \ndown from 19,800; H and H are 9.9/28.9 with 265,000 platelets.  Sputum is \ngrowing rare normal flora.  His CT scan shows persistence, although improved \naeration in the right upper lobe.  The left lower lobe and lateral lingula \nshow improvement in infiltrates.  \nMr. **NAME[AAA] is a gentleman that had a severe pneumonia.  Pneumococcus was \ncertainly a possible etiology that did not grow, although Pseudomonas cepacia \ndid eventually grow and he was treated with Zosyn.  Unfortunately, he seems \nto have developed C. diff, although those results are pending.  He is \ncurrently on Flagyl for that.  From a pulmonary standpoint, he still has \nsignificant radiographic abnormalities, but they have improved.  The air \nbronchograms are inconsistent with a postobstructive pneumonia.  At this \ntime, he has received adequate antibiotics and I would withhold further \nantibiotics from a pulmonary standpoint.  Mucomyst and nebulized \nbronchodilators are reasonable to help him clear his secretions, and he will \nneed a followup CT scan in about 2 months to document further clearing of \nthat upper lobe infiltrate.  \nThank you very much.  \n______________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], MD\nHS Job # 440707 / 36231 / \nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD: **DATE[Nov 02 2007] 11:36\nT: **DATE[Nov 02 2007] 11:41\n\n**CARBON-COPY\n\n\n\n\n',

He has a past history of coronary \nartery disease status post CABG in 2001.  He has hypertension and he has a \nhistory of colorectal cancer for which he underwent surgery and has a \ncolostomy in place.  This was done 15 years ago.  In late **DATE[Sep] the \npatient sustained a left-sided clavicular fracture and shoulder injury.  For \nthis he was admitted at **INSTITUTION.  He was being managed there and \nsubsequently was transferred to **INSTITUTION fro sepsis.  He was \nadmitted at the ICU at **INSTITUTION where he was managed for his \nsepsis.  Blood cultures from the outside hospital showed E. coli.  The \npatient was managed with IV antibiotics.  During his stay in the ICU he \ndeveloped a left-sided parietal infarction.  Infective endocarditis was ruled \nout on a transthoracic echocardiogram.  The patient was treated with \nAggrenox.  Also, during this time period the patient had shortness of breath \nand a cough productive of frothy white sputum.  His sputum cultures grew \n(_______________).  This was thought to be a contamination and a CT scan of \nthe chest showed multilobar pneumonia.  The patient was treated with IV \nZosyn.  He was kept on 1 liter of oxygen by nasal cannula, flutter valve \ntreatment, physical therapy, DuoNebs, and expectorant treatment was given.  \nAlso, during the hospital stay the patient was markedly depressed and was \nkept on Zoloft.  The patient was transferred on **DATE[Oct 9 2007], to \n**INSTITUTION Rehabilitation at **PLACE where his antibiotics for 2 weeks \nfor a completion of a 2-weeks'  course were continued.  About a week ago the \npatient was transferred to **NAME[VVV] again with productive cough of frothy \nsputum and shortness of breath.  Over there, Dr. (_______________) did a \nbronchoscopy.  According to his note, there was no endobronchial lesion in \nthe right upper lobe.  In the post bronchoscopy sputum and washings the \npatient grew fungus.  By this time on evaluating his imaging, he mentions in \nhis note that originally there was a right lower lobe, right upper lobe, and \nleft lower lobe infiltrate which are resolving.  The right upper lobe \ninfiltrate, however, is still persistent.  The patient was discharged back to \nSouthside Rehabilitation on IV Diflucan, starting on **DATE[Oct 27 2007].  At \nSouthside Rehabilitation the patient continued to have his productive cough \nand yesterday IV Zosyn was added by the patient's PCP.  He also added Flagyl \n500 mg p.o. t.i.d. to cover for C. difficile colitis.  Yesterday, the patient \nhad a sudden increase in colostomy output.  During 1 shift he had 1700 cc put \nout.  Also, he was noted to have a fever.  His white cell count yesterday had \njumped up to 24,000.  On **DATE[Oct 28 2007], it was 7.9.  Neutrophil count was \n72% and bandemia was 23%.  A sepsis workup was done and the patient was \npositive for C. difficile colitis.  Also, his UA was consistent with a UTI.  \nToday, the patient was noted to have a blood pressure of 80 to 90 systolic, \nwas tachycardic, and was noted to have PACs.  For this reason the patient was \ntransferred to **INSTITUTION for further management.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient had an MI in 1991.  In 2001 he had a \n4-vessel CABG.  He has hypertension.  Fifteen years ago he was diagnosed with \nrectal cancer.  He underwent a surgery and sustained a colostomy from that \nsurgery.  Since then he has not had any chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  \nHe is not being followed up by any oncologist and neither does he have a \ncardiologist.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per his history of present illness.

He presents from \nSouthside Rehabilitation with the following issues.\n1.  Clostridium difficile colitis.  The patient has been started on Flagyl \n500 mg p.o. t.i.d.  His Zosyn has been put on hold.  We are also starting \nLactinex 1 pack p.o. q.i.d.  I will check an abdominal x-ray as the patient \nis complaining of abdominal tenderness.  This is to rule out any toxic \nmegacolon or perforation.\n2.  Multilobar pneumonia.  The patient has already received Zosyn last month \nfor 2 weeks for this.  He has recently been started on Diflucan based on \nfungus that was grown in his bronchial washings.  I do not have the details \navailable of the bronchial report or the culture at this point in time.  We \nwill continue the IV Diflucan.  We will check a CT scan of the chest without \ncontrast.  We will consult Dr. **NAME[UUU]'s group.  We will also continue the \npatient's DuoNeb, Mucomyst, and guaifenesin and send off sputum cultures.\n3.  Dehydration and prerenal azotemia.  Reportedly, the patient has had a \nbump in his creatinine.  A couple of days ago, his creatinine was 0.9 and now \nit has increased to 3 at the rehabilitation.  This most likely seems prerenal \nbecause of the dehydration and decreased p.o. intake as well as vomiting.  We \nwill generously hydrate the patient.  The patient has been started on normal \nsaline at 200 mL per hour.  We will generously hydrate as the patient's \nejection fraction is 60%.  He does have a history of diastolic dysfunction.  \nTherefore, we will be careful not to cause volume overload.  Check urine \nelectrolytes but we will hold off on any further renal workup.  We will hold \nany nephrotoxic medications and renally adjust his medications.\n4.  Ectopic beats.  I will check an EKG and place the patient on a monitor.\n5.  Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, gastrointestinal prophylaxis, PT, and \nOT consult.  We will consult social work.\nThe patient has been discussed with the attending.\n______________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], Resident\nHS Job # 432079 / 36382 / \nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD: **DATE[Nov 01 2007] 20:17\nT: **DATE[Nov 01 2007] 20:40\n\n**CARBON-COPY\n\n\n\n\n",

The patient's chief complaint is increasing \ncolostomy output and weakness.\nThe patient's history began late **DATE[Sep 2007] when he felling incurring a \nclavicle fracture.  He was treated at **INSTITUTION.  While there, he \ndeveloped sepsis and transferred to **INSTITUTION for further \ntreatment and management.  Blood cultures from **INSTITUTION grew E. coli.  \nWhile at **INSTITUTION, the patient was found to have a right lung pneumonia on \nchest x-ray as well as CT scan.  He completed a course Zosyn.  During his \nstay, the patient developed a sudden onset right hemiparesis from a left \nparietal and bilateral inferior cerebellar CVA.  The patient was placed on \naspirin and Plavix.  He was discharged to **INSTITUTION, **PLACE for a \nrehabilitation program. \nThe patient stayed approximately a week and a half.  He was readmitted to \n**INSTITUTION with a productive cough.  Workup included bronchoscopy which \nrevealed a fungal infection on cultures.  The patient was placed on IV \nDiflucan and subsequently discharged back to **INSTITUTION, **PLACE.\nRecently, the patient was admitted to **INSTITUTION with increasing \ncolostomy output.  He was noted to have leukocytosis with a white count of \n24,000 and 23% bandemia.  The patient was transferred to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Nov 1 2007], for further treatment.\nThe patient was diagnosed as having C. difficile colitis.  His C. difficile \ntoxin assay was positive from his **DATE[Nov 1 2007], stool sample.  His blood \ncultures have shown no growth.  The patient has been placed on Lactobacillus \nalong with Flagyl.  He has shown clinical improvement with decreased \ncolostomy output.  His WBC count has decreased to 8.6.  The patient was also \ndehydrated, and his creatinine since improved to 1.4.  His chest CT showed \npersistent right upper lobe consolidation, but overall improved from previous \nradiographs.\nFrom a functional standpoint, the patient requires minimal assistance with \nhis transfer, minimal assistance to ambulate 5 feet using a wheeled walker, \nand requiring assistance to open his containers during meals.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery \nbypass graft in 2001, history of MI, hypertension, colorectal CA status post \ncolostomy 15 years ago, and hyperlipidemia.\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.\nALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\nMEDICATIONS:  As listed in the 36-hour report.  I have reviewed this list.\nPERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired coal miner.  He lived \nalone prior to his admission.  A former smoker.  Drinks alcohol occasionally. \nHe was independent prior to admission.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient feels tired and weak.  His right is weaker \ncompared to his left.  He denies any chest pain.  He does have exertional \ndyspnea, but overall better.  He reports cough, but this is also improved.  \nHe denies any swallowing problems.  Currently has a Foley catheter in place.  \nHe reports being continent prior to admission.  He has no neck or back pain.  \nHe denies any numbness or paresthesias.  Rest of his review of systems is \nnegative.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is thin elderly male.  He is awake.  He is \nalert.  He is oriented x3 in no acute distress.  His voice is wet and gurgly, \nhypophonic, but easily understandable.  Heart:  Distant.  Lungs:  With \nscattered rhonchi.  Abdomen: Soft and nontender.  Extremities: He has trace \nbilateral pretibial edema.  Skin:  Dry and scaly.  I did not look at his \nsacral coccyx for any pressure ulcers.  Neurologic:  He has full passive \nrange of motion of both upper and lower extremities with minimal pain at the \nend range.  Manual testing, left upper extremity is 5/5, right upper \nextremity is 3 to 4 over 5; in both lower extremities, it is limited \nsecondary to his position, but left TA and EHL is 5/5 and right TA and EHL is \n4+/5.  Muscle stretch reflexes are slightly brisker on the right.  He does \nnot have any clonus, and his plantar reflex is equivocal.  He does have \ndysmetria in both upper extremities, more significant on the right.\nIMPRESSION:  The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old male with a history of left \nparietal cerebrovascular accident and right hemiparesis.  He is admitted with \nClostridium difficile colitis.  He has had extensive and complicated course \nsince his initial admission in **DATE[Sep 2007].  He is not at his functional \nbaseline with decline in functional mobility, self care, as well as speech.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  \n1.  Consider modified barium swallow to evaluate his current swallowing \nstatus.\n2.  Agree with deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.\n3.  The patient will require an admission to the acute inpatient \nrehabilitation service.  He has the comprehensive therapy needs with physical \ntherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language pathology to address \nhis functional decline as well as extensive active medical issues requiring \nclose supervision and judicious management.\nThank you for allowing me to participate in his care.\n______________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], MD\nHS Job # 503658 / 36756 / \nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD: **DATE[Nov 04 2007] 18:20\nT: **DATE[Nov 05 2007] 03:41\n\n**CARBON-COPY\n\n\n\n\n",

He was doing well at the rehab; \nhowever, on the night before the day of admission, he started to have \ndiarrhea.  He did not respond to treatment.  C. diff toxin was sent, but the \npatient became hypotensive, his creatinine went up to 2 and BUN became \nelevated.  He became tachycardic, and showing irregular heart beats.  For all \nthese reasons, he was transferred to **INSTITUTION for further \nmanagement and evaluation.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with initial problems that \nincluded severe diarrhea confirmed later to be from C. diff colitis, it was \ntreated with Flagyl and Lactinex\n\\\tand seemed to improve slowly.\nHis other issue was hypotension and tachycardia related to dehydration and \nlow volume.  It was corrected with IV fluids.\nHe had renal failure on admission, the creatinine was 2.0 and elevated BUN.  \nThat seemed to correct with IV fluids, creatinine improved down to 1.2.\nHe was tachycardic and showing irregular heart beats on admission, that \nseemed to improve to normal sinus rhythm with controlled rate at the time of \ndischarge.\nThe patient had swelling in the right arm, there was question of DVT.  \nHowever,  venous Dopplers came back negative.  I would still watch that \nclosely, consider further evaluation if the swelling continues.\nThe patient continues to have the problem with dysphagia.  He is on dysphagia \ndiet.\nHowever, his main complaint and problem seem to be persistent congestion in \nthe lungs and sputum production and cough.  He had recent pneumonia which \nseemed to be getting better on CT scan and chest x-ray.  I wonder if he has \neither components of microaspiration or postnasal drip which could be \ncontributing.  Appropriate treatments are being given to that.  Other agents \ncould be added later in the future.\nAs the patient seemed to improve from the diarrhea standpoint and as his \nkidney function coming back to normal, his blood pressure and heart rate are \nimproving, we felt that he could go back to the **INSTITUTION Rehab to continue \nphysical therapy and rehabilitation.  He will continue his medications.  He \nneeds to follow up with his right arm swelling and his lung status.\nLABORATORY DATA:  Prior to discharge, his stool for occult blood was \nnegative.  His sodium was 140, potassium 3.9, chloride 119, BUN 17, \ncreatinine 1.4, calcium 8.2.  His INR was 21, TIBC 1 was 7 and iron \nsaturation was 20%, ferritin 251.\nHemoglobin was 9.0, hematocrit 26.8, and platelet count 255.\nDISPOSITION:  **INSTITUTION Rehab in stable condition.

The \npatient himself mentioned about him not feeling very well, so the family took \nthe patient to the emergency department where he was found to be disoriented \nto time, place, and person and subsequent CT scan of the head showed a lesion \nin his brain that looked either a tumor or bleeding.  For further evaluation, \nthe patient was referred to Neurosurgery, Dr. **NAME[ZZZ], for further evaluation, \nand presented to the emergency department.  On presentation to the emergency \ndepartment, the patient was awake, alert, but not oriented.  He was confused \nwith time, date, and also place.  He denied any headache, nausea, vomiting, \ndifficulty moving his extremities, or sensory problems.   \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \nThe past medical history includes:\n1. Surgical appendectomy.\n2. Lipoma resection.\n3. Also tonsillectomy.\nMEDICATIONS:\nThe patient states that he does not take any medications.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  \nHe does not smoke, drinks about a bottle of beer a day.\nALLERGIES:\nNO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nGENERAL:  This is a Caucasian male not in acute distress; however, confused \nand disoriented to time, place, and person.   \nVITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 130/68, pulse is 66 and regular, respiratory \nrate is 17, and saturation is 100% on two liters nasal cannula.   \nHEENT:  Pupils are equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular \nmovements are intact, no diplopia.   \nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.\nEXTREMITIES:  No swelling or redness.\nNEURO:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Strength is 5/5 throughout.  \nSensation is intact.   \nLABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:\nA CT scan of the head obtained showed a brain lesion, possible tumor or \nbleed.  An MRI was ordered and the result is pending by the time of \ndictation.  Blood work was obtained.  Those were not significantly abnormal.  \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThis is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old male who has questionable history of a brain tumor in \nthe past without any treatment who presented with confusion, found to have a \nbrain lesion by CT scan.  The patient continues to be confused; however, \nvital signs were stable and there was no significant neurological finding \nother than his confusion.  Here Neurosurgery was  \ncontacted and since the patient already had a bed under Dr. **NAME[ZZZ], he was \nadmitted to 5F for further evaluation of his brain lesion.  The patient \nremained hemodynamically and neurologically stable throughout this emergency \ndepartment stay. \nADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  BRAIN MASS.\n___________________________________\n**NAME[RRR QQQ], M.D.\n\nDictator:  **NAME[WWW XXX], M.D.\n**INITIALS\nD:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 18:38:13\nT:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 19:47:41\nR:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 19:47:41/klf\nJob ID:  367063/**ID-NUM\nCc:\n\n*** Dictated By: -**NAME[XXX, PPP] ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[RRR QQQ]  **DATE[Mar 02 2007] 11:02:34 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

The history, physical and plan were \nreviewed, I concur with their findings. I also independently examined and \nquestioned the patient.  \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  \nMr. **NAME[AAA] is **AGE[in 60s]-year-old gentleman who reportedly this morning forgot to \npick up his granddaughter from school, was then confused while driving and \nreportedly missed his driveway. The patient was seen at and outside hospital \nand a CT was done and there was what appeared to be an intracranial bleed \nversus mass seen. He was sent here for further evaluation by Neurosurgery. \nThe patient reports that he had a " mass in past" but it went away. He denies \nany focal numbness, weakness or tingling right now. No headache, no vision \nchanges, no nausea, no vomiting and no other medical symptoms to report. \nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \nHis review of systems is negative. \nHis allergies, past medical history and social history are per the resident \ndictation. \nHis medications are none. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nTemperature 36.9, 60, 118, 130/68.\nGENERAL: The patient is alert on my assessment. He is oriented to person and \nplace, but not so much the situation. He appears to be in no distress.  \nHEENT: The head is atraumatic. His pupils are equal and around. Sclerae is \nanicteric, unable to evaluate the fundus. Oropharynx is clear and moist.  \nNECK: The neck is supple. \nCARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm.\nLUNGS: The lungs are clear to auscultation.\nABDOMEN: The abdomen is soft, nontender and nondistended.\nNEURO: Neurologically his speech is clear and fluent, occasionally he is not \nmaking sense. I would give him a GCS of 14. On motor exam he has no evidence \nof pronator drift and (5/5) strength in the upper and lower extremities. \nFinger-to-nose is intact bilaterally.  \nED COURSE AND MEDICAL DECISION:  \nThe patient was seen by myself and the resident. The gentleman had either a \nbleed or a mass on his head CT at the posterior portion in the ventricle. It \nwas well demarcated and it appears to be more or a mass with possible \ncalcification or bleeding. We will repeat the head CT and obtain a MRI per \nNeurosurgery recommendation. The patient was planned to be a direct admit to \n5F and we are awaiting for his bed at this time. He otherwise remained \nneurologically intact during my exam, except as above and this was unchanged. \n\nRoutine laboratory data was sent. His INR is pending, but from the outside \nhospital this was less than 1. He is on no anticoagulants. I do not think \nthis represents meningitis or encephalolitis at this time. We will have him \nadmitted to neurosurgery.  \nADMISSION DIAGNOSIS(ES): \nINTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE.\nAdmit to Neurosurgery **ROOM. _____________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX], M.D.\nEMERGENCY MEDICINE \nAttending Physician \nDictator:  **NAME[WWW XXX], M.D.\nJK/dab\nD:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 17:45:26\nT:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 18:10:22\nR:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 18:10:22/dab\nJob ID:  367006/**ID-NUM\nCc:\n\n*** Dictated By: -**NAME[XXX, RRR] ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[WWW XXX]  **DATE[Mar 02 2007] 11:02:31 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

He was doing well at the rehab; \nhowever, on the night before the day of admission, he started to have \ndiarrhea.  He did not respond to treatment.  C. diff toxin was sent, but the \npatient became hypotensive, his creatinine went up to 2 and BUN became \nelevated.  He became tachycardic, and showing irregular heart beats.  For all \nthese reasons, he was transferred to **INSTITUTION for further \nmanagement and evaluation.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with initial problems that \nincluded severe diarrhea confirmed later to be from C. diff colitis, it was \ntreated with Flagyl and Lactinex\n\\\tand seemed to improve slowly.\nHis other issue was hypotension and tachycardia related to dehydration and \nlow volume.  It was corrected with IV fluids.\nHe had renal failure on admission, the creatinine was 2.0 and elevated BUN.  \nThat seemed to correct with IV fluids, creatinine improved down to 1.2.\nHe was tachycardic and showing irregular heart beats on admission, that \nseemed to improve to normal sinus rhythm with controlled rate at the time of \ndischarge.\nThe patient had swelling in the right arm, there was question of DVT.  \nHowever,  venous Dopplers came back negative.  I would still watch that \nclosely, consider further evaluation if the swelling continues.\nThe patient continues to have the problem with dysphagia.  He is on dysphagia \ndiet.\nHowever, his main complaint and problem seem to be persistent congestion in \nthe lungs and sputum production and cough.  He had recent pneumonia which \nseemed to be getting better on CT scan and chest x-ray.  I wonder if he has \neither components of microaspiration or postnasal drip which could be \ncontributing.  Appropriate treatments are being given to that.  Other agents \ncould be added later in the future.\nAs the patient seemed to improve from the diarrhea standpoint and as his \nkidney function coming back to normal, his blood pressure and heart rate are \nimproving, we felt that he could go back to the **INSTITUTION Rehab to continue \nphysical therapy and rehabilitation.

The \npatient himself mentioned about him not feeling very well, so the family took \nthe patient to the emergency department where he was found to be disoriented \nto time, place, and person and subsequent CT scan of the head showed a lesion \nin his brain that looked either a tumor or bleeding.  For further evaluation, \nthe patient was referred to Neurosurgery, Dr. **NAME[ZZZ], for further evaluation, \nand presented to the emergency department.  On presentation to the emergency \ndepartment, the patient was awake, alert, but not oriented.  He was confused \nwith time, date, and also place.  He denied any headache, nausea, vomiting, \ndifficulty moving his extremities, or sensory problems.   \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \nThe past medical history includes:\n1. Surgical appendectomy.\n2. Lipoma resection.\n3. Also tonsillectomy.\nMEDICATIONS:\nThe patient states that he does not take any medications.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  \nHe does not smoke, drinks about a bottle of beer a day.\nALLERGIES:\nNO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nGENERAL:  This is a Caucasian male not in acute distress; however, confused \nand disoriented to time, place, and person.   \nVITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 130/68, pulse is 66 and regular, respiratory \nrate is 17, and saturation is 100% on two liters nasal cannula.   \nHEENT:  Pupils are equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular \nmovements are intact, no diplopia.   \nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.\nEXTREMITIES:  No swelling or redness.\nNEURO:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Strength is 5/5 throughout.  \nSensation is intact.   \nLABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:\nA CT scan of the head obtained showed a brain lesion, possible tumor or \nbleed.  An MRI was ordered and the result is pending by the time of \ndictation.  Blood work was obtained.  Those were not significantly abnormal.  \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThis is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old male who has questionable history of a brain tumor in \nthe past without any treatment who presented with confusion, found to have a \nbrain lesion by CT scan.  The patient continues to be confused; however, \nvital signs were stable and there was no significant neurological finding \nother than his confusion.  Here Neurosurgery was  \ncontacted and since the patient already had a bed under Dr. **NAME[ZZZ], he was \nadmitted to 5F for further evaluation of his brain lesion.  The patient \nremained hemodynamically and neurologically stable throughout this emergency \ndepartment stay. \nADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  BRAIN MASS.\n___________________________________\n**NAME[RRR QQQ], M.D.\n\nDictator:  **NAME[WWW XXX], M.D.\n**INITIALS\nD:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 18:38:13\nT:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 19:47:41\nR:  **DATE[Feb 29 2007] 19:47:41/klf\nJob ID:  367063/**ID-NUM\nCc:\n\n*** Dictated By: -**NAME[XXX, PPP] ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[RRR QQQ]  **DATE[Mar 02 2007] 11:02:34 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',
